  Our project is a Settlers of Catan board generator that creates a virtual game board 
  with the proper distribution of resources and number tokens. The generator creates a 
  hexagonal game board with 19 tiles representing the 5 different resources (Sheep, 
  Wood, Ore, Brick, and Wheat) and the Desert.
